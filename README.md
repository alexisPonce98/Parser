# spring-proj4
This program is for an assignment in one of my classes. This assignments was intended to allow use to undertand the way that programming languages are compiled. 
For the assignment we were to parse a program written with the grammar that my professor had set up. We would also set up a link list of intruction nodes, consisting of 
different struct types. This list was then sent to the compiler where they were executed in order. Our Job was to be ale to set up the link list in a way that would allow
for a set of IF, WHILE, SWITCH and FOR conditionals. Not only would we have to set up the link list in the correct manner we also set up the variables location and values
using several different data structures.
